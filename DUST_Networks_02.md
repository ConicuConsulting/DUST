## Achievements

### Core Features

1. **Patient Creation:**

   - Seamlessly add new patients to the system, creating a unique tensor for each patient.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/create
     ```
2. **Tensor Updates:**

   - Dynamically update patient tensors with new data points.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John", "updates": [[0, 0, 98.6], [1, 1, 120]]}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/update
     ```
3. **Data Querying:**

   - Retrieve specific values or the entire tensor for a patient.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/query?name=John&x=0&y=0"
     ```
4. **Master Tensor Querying:**

   - Access a global view of all patients and their tensor indices.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/query_master
     ```

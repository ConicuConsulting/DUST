# DUST: Dynamic Unified Structured Tensors

## Technical Achievements

DUST (Dynamic Unified Structured Tensors) represents a revolutionary framework for managing, analyzing, and querying relational and time-evolving data through tensor-based systems. This document highlights the key technical milestones and achievements thus far.

## 1. Core Functionalities

### 1.1 Tensor Management

- **Master Tensor Implementation**:
  - Centralized management of patients and their associated tensors.
  - Ability to dynamically grow and link tensors as new data is introduced.
- **Dynamic Expansion**:
  - Tensor dimensions automatically expand to accommodate new data points, ensuring scalability without manual intervention.

### 1.2 CRUD Operations

- **Create**:
  - Endpoint to register new entities (e.g., patients) and allocate a dedicated tensor for each.
  - `POST /create`: Adds a new patient to the system, returning a unique ID and tensor index.
- **Update**:
  - Endpoint to update specific tensor values with support for dynamic resizing.
  - `POST /update`: Updates tensor cells with specified values, resizing the tensor if necessary.
- **Query**:
  - Endpoint to retrieve specific tensor values or entire tensor data.
  - `GET /query`: Fetches data for given `x` and `y` coordinates or the full tensor if unspecified.

## 2. Implementation Highlights

### 2.1 Flask API Endpoints

- **`/create`**:
  - Registers new patients in the master tensor.
  - Initializes a corresponding tensor for each patient.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/create
    ```
- **`/update`**:
  - Updates tensor data with new relationships or attributes.
  - Supports dynamic tensor resizing to accommodate out-of-bounds indices.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
        "name": "John Doe",
        "updates": [[0, 0, 98.6], [1, 1, 120]]
    }' http://127.0.0.1:5000/update
    ```
- **`/query`**:
  - Retrieves data for a specific tensor or cell.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/query?name=John%20Doe&x=0&y=0"
    ```

### 2.2 Dynamic Tensor Handling

- **Automatic Resizing**:
  - Tensors dynamically expand when new data exceeds current dimensions.
  - Ensures compatibility with unpredictable or sparse datasets.
- **NaN-Based Defaults**:
  - All uninitialized cells default to `NaN`, clearly distinguishing updated values from empty data.

## 3. Achievements

### 3.1 End-to-End Data Management

- **Seamless Creation and Updates**:
  - Fully functional APIs to create entities, update tensors, and query data with minimal effort.
- **Dynamic Growth**:
  - Tensors scale in real-time, making the framework adaptable to large and evolving datasets.

### 3.2 Querying Capabilities

- Efficient access to individual tensor cells or entire tensor structures.
- Support for fine-grained queries with user-specified coordinates.

### 3.3 Real-Time Interactions

- **Live Data Updates**:
  - Ability to update tensor relationships in real-time through API calls.
- **Instant Feedback**:
  - Each API operation returns relevant feedback (e.g., updated tensors) for validation and debugging.

## 4. Next Steps

### 4.1 Functional Enhancements

- Add endpoints for deleting patients and clearing tensors.
- Enable multi-dimensional tensors (e.g., adding a time axis).
- Introduce tensor relationships to model dependencies (e.g., linking patients to doctors).

### 4.2 Advanced Querying

- Allow for multi-cell queries (e.g., sub-tensor extractions).
- Support aggregated queries (e.g., average vitals over time).

### 4.3 Visualization and Analytics

- **Interactive Dashboards**:
  - Build dashboards using Plotly Dash to visualize tensors in real-time.
- **Data Insights**:
  - Graph-based visualizations for relationships and anomalies.

### 4.4 Deployment

- Dockerize the Flask application.
- Deploy to cloud platforms for scalability and global access.
- Secure the endpoints with authentication and rate limiting.

## 5. Conclusion

DUST provides a robust framework for managing and analyzing relational data with unparalleled flexibility and scalability. The journey so far demonstrates its potential to revolutionize how dynamic, multi-dimensional datasets are stored, updated, and queried. With continued development and innovation, DUST will become a cornerstone for future data-driven applications.
